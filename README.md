## How this web app was made

This web app was built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and a few other dependencies, mostly notabely [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-ca). The Stripe documentation made it really simple and easy to implement payments into the site.

More of the app's structural layer is detailed below:
